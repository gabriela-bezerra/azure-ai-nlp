# Exploring Azure Speech Studio and Language Studio

In this repository, we explore the capabilities of Azure Speech Studio and Language Studio, two powerful tools for natural language processing (NLP) and speech analysis. We provide an overview of the process, share insights, and discuss the possibilities that these tools offer.



## Azure Speech Studio

Azure Speech Studio is a comprehensive platform for speech-to-text and speech analysis. It allows you to transcribe and analyze audio data in real-time or through post-call processing.

### Accessing Speech Studio

To get started with Speech Studio, follow these steps:

1. Access the Speech Studio portal.
2. Set up or create a resource for your speech processing needs.

### Real-time Speech-to-Text Demo

Speech Studio provides a demo for real-time speech-to-text conversion. You can select a pre-recorded audio sample or record your own audio to see the speech being transcribed in real-time.

For more information on getting started, pricing, and sample code, refer to the [Speech SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk).

### Post-call Transcription and Analytics

Speech Studio also offers post-call transcription and analytics capabilities. You can upload your own audio data or use standard samples to analyze sentences and generate call summaries.

#### Analyze Sentences

The Conversation PII (Preview) feature transcribes audio files and identifies sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) into pre-defined classes. It also provides sentence-level sentiment scores.

#### Call Summary

The Conversation Summarization (Preview) feature generates a summary of issues and resolutions from a two-party conversation, particularly between a customer and an agent.

For more sample code related to post-call transcription and analytics, check out the [Speech SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/scenarios).



## Azure Language Studio

Azure Language Studio is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

### Accessing Language Studio

To access Language Studio, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Create a new Language Service resource.
3. Fill out the form and deploy the resource.
4. Navigate to the [Language Studio page](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/home).

### Classify Text

In the Language Studio, go to the "Classify text" tab and select "Analyze sentiment and mine opinions" to perform sentiment analysis on your text data.

## Insights and Possibilities



Through my exploration of Azure Speech Studio and Language Studio, I gained the following insights:

- Speech Studio provides a convenient way to transcribe and analyze speech data in real-time or through post-call processing.
- The Conversation PII feature helps identify sensitive information in audio conversations.
- The Conversation Summarization feature generates concise summaries of issues and resolutions from customer-agent interactions.
- Language Studio offers powerful tools for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights from textual data.

These tools open up a wide range of possibilities, such as:

- Improving customer service by analyzing call recordings and generating actionable insights.
- Monitoring and analyzing social media sentiment to gauge public opinion about products or services.
- Enhancing accessibility by providing real-time speech-to-text transcription for individuals with hearing impairments.
- Automating the process of identifying and redacting sensitive information in audio and text data.
